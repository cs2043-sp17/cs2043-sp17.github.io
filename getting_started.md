To complete the assignments, you will need access to a Unix development environment.  If
you do not already have a native Unix installation, you will need to configure a
"Virtual Machine (VM)."  The short version is that a VM is just another application that
your native operating system runs, where this application is another operating system.
Think Inception.

## Do I need a Virtual Machine?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Not everybody needs to setup a Virtual Machine.

- If you are running Windows on your computer / tablet, the answer is **yes**.
- If you are running Mac OSX, the answer is **not necessarily**.  Mac OSX *is* a
  Unix-based operating system.  Though I encourage you to configure one so you can
  play with Linux.
- If you are using a Chromebook, then the answer is **most likely not**.
  Unfortunately, I do not have one and cannot confirm or deny.
- If you are running some form of Linux already, then the answer is **no**.
