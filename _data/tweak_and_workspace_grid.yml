    If you want to increase / decrease font sizes for various components of the OS, this
    is the easiest way to achieve it.

    clock in the top-bar to see the calendar.

  title: Sloppy Mouse and Auto-Raise
  description: >
    Sloppy focus means that keyboard keys entered will get sent to whatever program the
    **mouse** is hovering over.  You may **strongly dislike this**, if so change it back
    to `click`.  Auto-raise brings the window your mouse is hovering over to the top
    after a little bit.  You may want to disable this too.

  title: Preparation for Workspace Grid
  description: >
    In order for the Workspace Grid extension to function, we need to set a `static`
    number of workspaces.  If you wanted to do a 2x2 grid, for example, you would set
    this to `4` instead of `9`.

  title: Go to the Extensions Tab
  description: >
    We just downloaded a `.zip` of the extension we want to install, in the `Install
    Shell Extension` row, where the mouse is hovering in the picture, click on the file
    dialog that says `(None)`.

    In your `Downloads` folder, select the Workspace Grid `.zip` file that was
    downloaded and click `Open` in the top right of the file dialog.

  title: Restart Gnome
  description: >
    You will be asked to restart your gnome session, click on `Restart Session`.  If you
    accidentally closed this, you can either log out and log back in (not lock the
    screen, but fully log out), or type `alt+F2` at the same time (Mac people: remember
    you need to add the `fn` key).  A dialog will pop up, type `r` and hit `enter`.
    This just issued a `r`estart request to gnome.

  title: Workspace Grid Installed, Needs Configuration
  description: >
    The installation worked, click on the cog wheel to open up the settings for the
    Workspace Grid Extension.

  title: Set the Number of Workspaces
  description: >
    Number of rows times the number of columns should equal whatever the number of
    `static` workspaces you set in the `Workspaces` tab of `gnome-tweak-tool`.  The
    extension **will** break if you do not.  Because I like my workspaces to wrap
    around, I slide all of them to `on`.

  title: End Result
  description: >
    Now that you have the settings configured, in the `Extensions` tab of
    `gnome-tweak-tool` make sure that you have slid `Workspace Grid` to be `on`.  Now
    hit the `super` key to get into the overview.
