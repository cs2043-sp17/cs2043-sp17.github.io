All a workspace does is give you another "desktop".  This makes it so that you can keep
multiple full-screen applications open, and switch between them by simply switching
workspaces.  Just having workspaces, though, is not enough (in my opinion).  I use a
"grid" of workspaces, specifically a 3x3 grid so that I have 9 workspaces total.  On a
typical day, I normally have my grid setup like this:

{% include configurations/workspaces_and_overall_appearance/overview.html %}

Obviously, how you use it should be what works for you.  Because I always configure
"wrapping" on my workspaces (if you are in the top-right cell and move one workspace to
the right, you end up in top-left), I basically organize things across columns.  So with
the setup shown above, since I'm mostly using my terminal / editing code / looking
things up online, I can very quickly switch between these with no more than two
workspace switches.  I also tend to leave the right-most column as "filler", and put
items there (e.g. a PDF I'm reading or something).

These have been configured for you already on the course VMs, but it is good for you to
know how to replicate / change this.  For example, if you are just starting out with a
grid setup you might want to dial it back to 2x2 (4 workspaces total).  You may also
temporarily need more -- I was writing a term paper once and ended up switching to
**6x6** because there were so many papers I had to keep referring to / citing ;)
