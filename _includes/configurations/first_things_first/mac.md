1. Update your operating system through the App Store.
  - Instructions can be found [here](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201541).
2. Install the Command Line Tools.  You should already have these if you have already
   installed XCode.  Otherwise, open a terminal and execute

   ```bash
   $ xcode-select --install
   ```
   There will be a pop-up with some license agreements etc.  Follow them.
3. You should also now have `git` as well as `vim`.
4. Download and install [Sublime Text 3 for OSX](https://www.sublimetext.com/3).
