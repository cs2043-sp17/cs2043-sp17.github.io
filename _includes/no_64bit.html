          If you are having this issue, then you need to enable something in the BIOS
          called "VT-x".  This exists to provide "security", and is usually disabled by
          default.  Refer to <a href="http://www.fixedbyvonnie.com/2014/11/virtualbox-showing-32-bit-guest-versions-64-bit-host-os/#.Vqj7KCorKNg">
          this article</a> for the solution.
        </p>

        <p>
          You can also search for "enable VT-x (insert computer model)" to find a
          solution.  For example, if you had a Dell Inspiron, you would search for
          "enable VT-x Dell Inspiron <strong>(model number)</strong>".  Use the model
          number to get better results.
        </p>

        <p>
          If your computer does not support VT-x, e-mail me immediately with your
          computer make and model.  I may produce 32bit VMs if people are having trouble,
          but would prefer not to.
        </p>

          Lastly, be <strong>very</strong> careful in the BIOS.  Do not change anything
          you do not need to, as this can produce adverse problems and may make it so
          that you cannot start your operating system (depending on what you did).
