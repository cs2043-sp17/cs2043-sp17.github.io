## Overview
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CS 2043 is a seven week, two credit, S/U only course. It runs from January 25th through
March 17, 2017.

There are two important dates where the registrar is concerned:

- Last day to add: February 1st, 2017
- Last day to drop: February 8th, 2017

The goal of this course is to provide you with a high-level exposure to a wide
range of Unix tools.  From the basics of getting your Unix environment setup, to
using your terminal, to building complex programs in a Unix environment, this
class aims to give you the base toolset to continue developing in a Unix
environment.  That is, you should not expect to exit the course with a mastery
of "everything there is to know about Unix."  Instead, you should expect to exit
the course with an understanding of how to navigate and configure a Unix
environment, as well as have the confidence and tools to solve future problems
(e.g. ones you did not encounter in this course) on your own.

As with any course, regardless of the subject, you do not really learn something
until you sit down and try it out yourself.  The lecture and assignments are
designed with this in mind &mdash; you should expect to learn the material by
interacting with it directly.  The course material is designed assuming you have
no prior experience developing in a Unix environment, but does assume that you
have been exposed to solving Computer Science problems at an introductory level
(in any flavor / language).  You are expected to put in an appropriate amount of
effort to complete the assignments.  Ultimately, what you put into the course is
what you will get out of it.
